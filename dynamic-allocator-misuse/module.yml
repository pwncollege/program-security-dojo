  The glibc heap consists of many components distinct parts that balance performance and security.
  In this introduction to the heap, the thread caching layer, `tcache` will be targeted for exploitation.
  `tcache` is a fast thread-specific caching layer that is often the first point of interaction for programs working with dynamic memory allocations.
