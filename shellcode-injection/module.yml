challenges:
- id: level-4
  name: level4
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but your inputted data is filtered before execution.
- id: level-5
  name: level5
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but the inputted data cannot contain any form of system call
    bytes (syscall, sysenter, int), can you defeat this?
- id: level-6
  name: level6
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but the inputted data cannot contain any form of system call
    bytes (syscall, sysenter, int), this challenge adds an extra layer of difficulty!
- id: level-7
  name: level7
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but all file descriptors (including stdin, stderr and stdout!)
    are closed.
- id: level-8
  name: level8
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but you only get 18 bytes.
- id: level-9
  name: level9
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but your input has data inserted into it before being executed.
- id: level-10
  name: level10
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but your input is sorted before being executed!
- id: level-11
  name: level11
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but your input is sorted before being executed and stdin is
    closed.
- id: level-12
  name: level12
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but every byte in your input must be unique.
- id: level-13
  name: level13
  description: Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but this time you only get 12 bytes!
- id: level-14
  name: level14
  description: "Write and execute shellcode to read the flag, but this time you only get 6 bytes :)"
