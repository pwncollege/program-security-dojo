  It is all too easy to live life without questioning the arcane logic underlying our reality.
  How do the programs we use every day actually work?
  How do the mysteries deep within these programs impact their security?
  Hackers delve into these secrets, learning the subtle dance that all programs follow, and infusing it with unexpected improvisation.
  In this dojo, you will not only learn the true form of this dance, but develop the skill to impact it.

  description: |
    Welcome to **Shellcode Injection**, the deep dive into the choreography of code execution, where you don't just tap into the rhythm of a system, but you take the lead, guiding the entire ensemble of processes, threads, and instructions.
    
    Once the gates of execution are breached, what follows?
    Is it the end of the battle, or merely the beginning of a symphony?
    How does one communicate with the very core of a machine, dictating its every move, turning threats into opportunities, limitations into launching pads?
    
    For the hackers among us, the dance begins with shellcode.
    But mastering this dance isn't about merely memorizing steps; it's about improvisation, anticipation, and adaptation.
    
    Throughout this module, you'll dive deep into:
    - **Execution Environments**: Navigate the different arenas your shellcode might be thrown into, from the predictable world of memory allocation to the wild terrains of stack-based randomness.
    - **Filters & Constraints**: Often, the dance floor isn't clear. There might be traps set up, from the dreaded 'H' bytes checker to the cunning bubblesort sorter, ready to trip your shellcode up. Can you weave through these obstacles, adjusting your steps on the fly?
    - **Shellcoding Techniques**: With the right steps, even the most intricate of routines can be bypassed. Master techniques such as nop sleds, self-modifying code, position-independent practices, and the cunning of two-stage shellcodes to remain unstoppable.
    
    Dancing with a processor isn't just about knowing the steps, but understanding the language and semantics of each instruction.
    While you'll have the stage to yourself, we ensure you're never alone on this journey.
    Equip yourself with these invaluable scrolls of wisdom:
    - [x64.syscall.sh](https://x64.syscall.sh): Your cheat sheet for syscalls. A glance here, and you're always ahead.
    - [Syscalls Manpage](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscalls.2.html): Understand not just the calls, but their deeper implications.
    - [Felix Cloutier](https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/): Dive into the heartbeats of instructions, ensuring you're always in step.    
    - [x86asm Reference](http://ref.x86asm.net/coder64.html): Decode the bytes into moves, turning the tables on any challenge.

    As you embark on this journey, remember, it's not just about taking control; it's about finesse, elegance, and the joy of the dance.
    In the vast assembly halls of x64, the processor awaits your cue.
    So, put on your dancing shoes, and let's speak the language of the processor!

      - A good place to start is a series of walkthroughs of several hacking challenges by ASU's own Adam Doupe on his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGt-0OOAFcM&list=PLK06XT3hFPziMAZj8QuoqC8iVaEbrlZWh).

      As mentioned in the slides, there are a number of useful tools for this assignment!
      Here is a (non-exhaustive) list:

      * `gdb` will let you run and inspect the state of these programs.
        Please check out the Debugging Refresher module.
        We have also provided a quick briefer here.
        Some useful gdb concepts:
         * Know the difference between `step instruction` (`si`) and `next instruction` (`ni`).
           It boils down to the fact that `si` will follow jumps, and `ni` will step over jumps.
           This means that if you use `si`, you will quickly find yourself crawling through libc code, which is insane and unnecessary.
         * You can use `x/i $rip` to disassemble the next instruction that will be executed.
           You can call `display/i $rip` to make the next instruction display every time gdb prompts you for input.
           You can also do `x/2i` and `display/2i` to print two (or other quantities of) instructions.
         * The `disas` command will disassemble the current function that you are looking at.
         * gdb can be scripted!
           Look up conditional breakpoints and scriptable breakpoints in the gdb manual.
         * Modern binaries are _position independent_, meaning that they can be loaded anywhere in memory when they run.
           GDB will load them at the offset `0x555555554000`.
           This means that if objdump is telling you that main starts at some address like, `0x100`, the address when debugging with GDB will be `0x555555554100`
      * `strings` will list printable strings in the file.
        This is useful for looking for constant strings that the program checks for (such as file names and so on) in the course of getting input.
        Keep in mind that the options for string include a minimum size that it will print.
      * Don't forget about pwntools! You will need to interact heavily with these programs. Do it right (with pwntools).
      * `rappel` is a nice tool to help you figure out what certain instructions do.
      * Tools for reverse engineering actual binaries:
         * IDA, accessible via the Desktop in the dojo, is the industry standard of reverse-engineering tools.
         * Ghidra, also accessible via the Desktop in the dojo, is an open source direct competitor to IDA that is used and loved by many.
         * angr-management, also accessible via the Desktop in the dojo, is an open source up-and-coming reversing tool with some advanced functionality.
         * [Binary Ninja Cloud](https://cloud.binary.ninja), accessible separately through your web browser, is a free binary reverse engineering tool.
         * In a pinch, `objdump -d -M intel the_binary` will disassemble the binary you want to look at.
           `-M intel`, in that command, makes objdump give you nice and readable Intel assembly syntax.
